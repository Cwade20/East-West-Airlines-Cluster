# East-West-Airlines-Cluster
## In this exercise, your goal is to use cluster analysis to identify segments of passengers that have similar characteristics for the purpose of targeting different segments for different types of mileage offers. 
Apply k-Means clustering using all the attributes (except ID#) with k = 2 through k = 6. For each k, record the Davies Bouldin Index.

(Hint: Remember to normalize the variables before clustering.)

List the DBI for different values of k. Based on the DBI metric, how many clusters of passengers are there?

Describe the characteristics of the passengers in each cluster for your chosen number of clusters (i.e., for the best k)

Based on the characteristics of the clusters, give them appropriate names.
